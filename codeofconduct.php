                            The Shangri-La group of companies including Shangri-La Asia Limited, Shangri-La International Hotel Management Limited, their respective subsidiaries, affiliates and controlled entities, as well as hotels and properties operated by the Group (collectively, “Group”), are committed to the core values that define the Group’s reputation and brand: integrity, fairness, respect, ethical business conduct and excellence in service.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            We require our suppliers, their employees, subsidiaries, affiliates and sub-contractors (collectively, “Suppliers”) to uphold the Group’s core values and adhere to ethically, socially and environmentally responsible practices when doing business with the Group.

                            As a minimum, Suppliers are required to comply with the Code. Failure to comply with any provision of the Code could result in termination of the business and/or contractual relationship with the Group. The Group prefers to do business with Suppliers whose operations and business practices exceed the requirements of the Code.
