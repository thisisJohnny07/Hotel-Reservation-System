                          </p>
                          <p style="text-align: left;">
                          You are required to comply with the Hotel’s rules and regulations relating to the use of any of the Hotel’s facilities, equipment and services such as swimming pools, saunas and steam rooms, gymnasiums, spas, massage and beauty therapists, fitness instructors, beaches, water slides, and fitness equipment. The use of these facilities, equipment and services are entirely at your own risk. To the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any personal injury or loss or damage to property caused to any person arising from or in connection with your use of the Hotel’s facilities, equipment and services.
